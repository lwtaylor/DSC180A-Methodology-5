### Section A01, Albert Hsaio

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**<br>
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter was learning more about how medical images work and how much more involved they are than one may think. I didn't realize that the dynamic range of the image was so high compared to standard RBG images that most people observe. I also learned to appreciate the domain knowledge that radiologists have because I would be lost trying to decipher these images without the help of a mentor with expert knowledge. <br>
**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** <br>
One potential investigation I would like to pursue for Quarter 2 is connecting LLM's to an image based deep learning model, so that the LLM learns how to describe the results of the model (or multiple models!) based off of similar annotations written by radiologists and medics themselves. <br>
**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**<br>
One potential change I'd make in the approach I had taken in the Quarter 1 Project is perhaps looking more at similar resources in my approach to the problem, such as Kaggle competition code for similar medical image tasks. I think I spent too much time fiddling around with the task of replicating the paper and trying to improve on my own with data augmentations rather than researching what people have already done, and developing those skills I need to apply to my own project, not just for replication. <br>
**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**<br>
Another technique that I am interested in using in next quarter's project is learning how to use autoencoder on medical image datasets to learn important features in a medical image related to a disease or multiple diseasses, which could be of use to medical professionals.
